TOP's first mission: Recipe

So, aside from I'm not a good cook, I am also anxious about setting 
this all up on my own. Without TOP's instructions.

Let's see, I think I'll go for Pork Sinigang, no, let's do Stir-fry 
vegetable noodles.

I will wrap-up basically all I can squeezed-out of my brain from the 
previous lesson thus far.
I'll start with making sure I write the boilerplate exactly as it should be, and then I think I would like to explore combining UL and OL. And then accentuate a lot of commits. Ohhh and I'll lean on absolute path more than relative.
